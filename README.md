# StaRT
Beginner RayTracing project

## Give it a try
Just `make` it!

Or if you are not familiar with compiling things do:
1) open terminal
2) type:
```
cd ~/Desktop
git clone *clone_url* StaRT
sh update.sh
make
```

## What is it?
PBR Ray/Path tracing application written in pure C with rendering support on Metal (MacOS only for now)

### Features
1) 4 base objects: sphere, cone, cylinder and plane
2) PBR materials
3) Server-based architecture, render on multiple PCs at the same time
4) Metal on MacOS is fast

### TODO list
4) Textures for base objects
5) Support .obj files
6) HDR texture background/lightning
7) PBR texture maps for materials
8) Negative 'boolean' objects
